With this booklet I release:

\hypertarget{estimateps}{%
\subsection{EstimatePS}\label{estimateps}}

EstimatePS is a powershell commandlet to estimate tasks from the command
line, implemented but not limited to Powershell Core. The code is part
of this repository. But it is also available through the Powershell
Gallery.

\begin{verbatim}
Install-Module EstimatePS
\end{verbatim}

May it be of service to those with powershell and the need for time estimates.
