# A003 - 10 categories

## Description

Another idea how we might become better than A001 is that we use categories. We divide the tasks into 10 groups that have distinct properties. We only have to find out what a good group would look like. This could potentially reduce the dispersion especially around the smaller tasks which might save us from some error.

But how to do this in a smart way?
