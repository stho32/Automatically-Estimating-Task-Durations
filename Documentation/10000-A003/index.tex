To be better than A001 we could use a categorization.
For that we divide all tasks into 10 groups with similarities. 
Our target here is to reduce the dispersion within those groups. E.g. we know that there are a lot of tasks below half an hour duration. A001 often claims they are more costly. If we could clearly say that a task would belong to that category we could reduce our error margin here.
But how can we accomplish that?

\subsubsection{A003.1}

We divide our tasks using a linear scale
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item smaller than 30 minutes,
\item bigger than 30 minutes and less than one hour,
\item bigger than 1 hour and less than 2 hours
\item bigger than 2 hour and less than 3 hours
\item bigger than 3 hour and less than 4 hours
\item bigger than 4 hour and less than 5 hours
\item bigger than 5 hour and less than 6 hours
\item bigger than 6 hour and less than 7 hours
\item bigger than 7 hour and less than 8 hours
\item bigger than 8 heures
\end{enumerate}

Our algorithm tries to identify significant words that are unique par category:
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item collect all words in a category
\item for all categories:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \tightlist
        \item remove all words that are somehow mentioned in another category
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
