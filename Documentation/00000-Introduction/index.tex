I want to make it short. Guessing task durations is a mess. You can put
a lot of effort in making time estimates. Still they will be not good.
And while you strife to make perfect estimates you will find yourself
investing more and more time - possibly a lot more than the task is
worth.

More than that: estimating tasks hurts. Until noone wants to estimate
task durations anymore. With automation you can circumvent this:

It is clear, that it is just an estimate. Because the algorithm cannot
have a clue what it is actually guessing. It is definitly better than
nothing. It is systematic - which is an advantage. And computers can
learn from big amounts of data. People can only learn so much, until
they are stuck.

Let us see, if the idea is working or not. Maybe not. But, since the
only thing we have to loose is bad estimates and the only thing we can
gain is bad estimates that do not make effort - what the heck.
