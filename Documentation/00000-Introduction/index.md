# Foreword

I want to make it short. Guessing task durations is a mess. You can put a lot of effort in making time estimates. Still they will be not good. And while you strife to make perfect estimates you will find yourself investing more and more time - possibly a lot more than the task is worth.

More than that: estimating tasks hurts. Until noone wants to estimate task durations anymore. 
With automation you can circumvent this:

It is clear, that it is just an estimate. Because the algorithm cannot have a clue what it is actually guessing. It is definitly better than nothing. It is systematic - which is an advantage. And computers can learn from big amounts of data. People can only learn so much, until they are stuck. 

Let us see, if the idea is working or not. Maybe not. But, since the only thing we have to loose is bad estimates and the only thing we can gain is bad estimates that do not make effort - what the heck.
