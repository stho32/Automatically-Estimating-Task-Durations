\section{The Algorithms}

Find the descriptions of each algorithm here, placed in an own section. 

You can find a reference implementation of each algorithm in the "Source" directory in the accompaigning github repository: 
https://github.com/stho32/Automatically-Estimating-Task-Durations .

If you want to roll your own data that is actually not a problem.
In that case you need to comply to a given csv format and change the configuration.json in the Scripts directory accordingly. 
There will be a section about that.
