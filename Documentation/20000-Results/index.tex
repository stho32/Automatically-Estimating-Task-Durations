\subsection{Error distribution in tasks below or equal 40 hours duration}

Our data, at the moment, is very limited. 
Especially above 40 hours duration you will find that there are just a few tasks that ever got there.
And since this is the case the algorithms do not have many chances to "get that right".

Since that is the case, we have decided to cut the graphs >= 40 hours. 
This way we can see the results better in the lower ranges.
It is not far of to just accept that tasks above a certain range should only be guessed when
enough data is available and in case you are curious: yes, if you could see the rest of the graphs, there
is not much more than big errors to find.
