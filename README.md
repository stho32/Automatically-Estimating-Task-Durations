# Estimating Task Durations

Automatically

## The problem

When developing software you keep being asked "how long do you think that will take?". 

While this is a necessary thing for the business to know about which route to take it is also a disaster: 

- when guessing how long something will take we do not know a lot about the task
- we mostly forget about the context and
- we mostly forget other tasks that we still need to complete

... and many more errors are made.

And those estimations keep being thrown back at us "why isn't this complete yet" "you said four days, today is the fifth day, why..." and suddenly we are in a psychological trap as well which will haunt us and our colleges in the sleep and make us not wanting to guess anything anymore _ever_.

Still the business needs to ask. And still it remains a bad idea.

## The proposed solution

We automate it.
